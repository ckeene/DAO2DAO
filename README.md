# DAO2DAO

DAOs are collective organizations enabled by crypto technology. With over $4B in liquid assets, DAOs have rapidly expanding economic potential.

Because DAOs are decentralized and collaborative, they partner naturally with other DAOs who share their culture and decision making approach. This means that individual DAOs can work together to accomplish goals larger than any one DAO could achieve.

This white paper will describe how DAOs work with each other, for example protocol DAOs working with service DAOs to accelerate the development of new smart contracts (e.g., Compound and dOrg), or community DAOs working together to build infrastructure that makes it easier to create and manage DAOs (e.g., Aragon and Gnosis). 

The white paper is based on interviews and surveys of existing DAO leaders.
